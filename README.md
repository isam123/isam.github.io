During this quarter, I was primarily engaged in core development efforts, focusing on the FDC Tax Forms document type and contributing to enhancements on UI Table-related documents. I actively participated in release validations and assisted QA with enhancement-related testing. Additionally, I supported the C1 template updates to ensure compliance with UXD standards and continued collaboration with the UXD Architect, carrying forward the remaining C1 changes from previous quarters.

I had ongoing interactions with our Tech Lead, which provided valuable feedback on team collaboration and performance. I also had the opportunity to contribute to the Bootstrap migration initiative, gaining exposure and learning in that area.

Next Quarter Focus:

Looking ahead, my learning objectives are centered around WI and content-related development, specifically focusing on WI Subgraph integration and the Treatment Selector module. I plan to stay consistent with scheduled learning sessions to further strengthen my contributions.
